## define

Hi, I'm ***define***. I'm a simple CLI interface for performing a [Google](https://google.com) + **define** search. 

Just a quick note before you can use me, I do require a valid [CSE ID](https://cse.google.com/cse/all) and [API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/customsearch.googleapis.com/overview).

### Installation

The creator did not include downloadable (it's a word, look it up üòÅ), so you'll need to install and build using [Go](https://golang.org/).

```
$ go get -u github.com/elliottpolk/define
```

### Usage

Since you'll need to configure me before use, the ```-c | -config``` flag should help. You should note that the sample *key* and *CSE ID* are not actually real. So... be sure to generate your own.

```
$ define -c
Please provide a valid Google API key:
If6VR9J8FNuozeCYe2PGjxb0qrgss4wk3PJlPbJ
Please provide a valid custom search engine ID ('cx') value:
256323651702721704984:UfRCV4tMrsL
```

To ***define*** a a phrase you'll need to use the ```-p | -phrase``` flag along with the phrase. If you're looking for more than one word, it should be wrapped in ```""```.

```

I will also allow for some poor spelling. I'll be sure to give you the corrected ***define*** term and the resulting definitions.

```

I'm pretty dependant on Google at this point, so... if they get it wrong, I get it wrong. I also do **not** give the option to ***Search instead for***... yet.

## Thanks ~
